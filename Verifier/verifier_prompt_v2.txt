##Question:
How does Angular handle two-way data binding, and which directive is primarily used for this purpose?

##Reference:
Angular implements two-way data binding using the [(ngModel)] directive. It synchronizes the data between the component class and the template. Any changes in the template update the model, and changes in the model update the view, ensuring seamless synchronization.

##Claim:
Angular handles two-way data binding using the *ngIf directive to conditionally update the view.

{  
    "output": "Contradiction",
    "reason": "The *ngIf directive is used for conditionally rendering elements, not for two-way data binding, which requires [(ngModel)]."
}
