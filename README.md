# AI’m Right  

## Inspiration  
Exam season can feel like an uphill battle—juggling lecture videos, endless notes, and the challenge of synthesizing everything into a cohesive study guide. This chaos inspired us to create *AI’m Right*: a solution that doesn’t just help you ace your quizzes but also revolutionizes how you process and engage with complex academic content.  

## What It Does  
AI’m Right is a powerful *Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)* pipeline combined with a *Multimodal Indexing Engine*. Its key features include:  
- *Smart Quiz Generation*: Effortlessly create customized quizzes based on your lecture materials.  
- *Handout Creation*: Transform hours of lecture content into concise, easy-to-digest handouts.  
- *Lecture Video Search*: Navigate large video archives to pinpoint specific topics or concepts in seconds.  

With AI’m Right, your study time becomes more focused, efficient, and impactful.  

## How We Built It  
Our tech stack includes:  
- *Streamlit-powered Python frontend* for an intuitive user experience.  
- *Flask backend* for robust performance and scalability.  
- Integration with leading *Large Language Models (LLMs)* such as Claude, OpenAI, and all-MiniLM-L6-v2.  
- Advanced *Multimodal APIs* like Marengo to process and analyze diverse data types.  
- *Pinecone Vector Database* for efficient and scalable storage and retrieval of vectorized data.  
- An *ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline* leveraging Aryn and Sycamore to preprocess, index, and manage multimodal data seamlessly.  
- Collaborative version control through a *shared GitHub repository*, ensuring smooth team workflows and proper code versioning.  

Every feature was thoughtfully designed to create a seamless user experience.
