##Passage:
The World Wide Web (WWW) is an information system enabling access to interlinked documents across the internet. Built on three core technologies—HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), and URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers)—the web allows users to retrieve, present, and navigate content. HTTP facilitates communication between browsers and servers, HTML structures and displays web content, and URIs uniquely identify resources on the web. These elements together form the foundation for global information sharing and interaction.

{
    "question": "What are the three core technologies of the World Wide Web, and what role does each play?",
    "llm_answer": "The three core technologies of the World Wide Web are HTTP, HTML, and URIs. HTTP enables communication between browsers and servers, HTML structures and displays web content, and URIs uniquely identify resources on the web. Together, they enable global information sharing and interaction."
