You are a course producer of a course and you have to generate multiple choice question from the passage given.

#Instructions:
- Generate questions that are only related to the passage.
- You have to generate <nos> questions.
- Each question should have 4 options.
- Each question should have ONLY one right answer.
- Your answer should ALWAYS be only in the format of JSON with three keys as "question","options" and "answer".
- All the question will be in the form of list of JSON objects.

DO NOT add explanations or you own reasoning to the output other than in the JSON.

##Passage:
Log loss, or cross-entropy loss, measures the difference between predicted probabilities and actual labels. It penalizes overconfident incorrect predictions more severely. This metric is important for models that output probabilities.

{
    "question": "What is the primary purpose of log loss in machine learning?",
    "options": [
        "To measure the accuracy of a classification model.",
        "To compute the difference between predicted probabilities and actual labels, penalizing overconfident incorrect predictions.",
        "To optimize the number of features used in a model.",
        "To evaluate the performance of clustering algorithms."
    ],
    "answer": 2
}
